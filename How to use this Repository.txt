1. Creating a clone of the repository on your computer

Create the new folder in which you would like to store the repository.
Right-click in the new folder.
Select the option "Git Bash". If you can't find this option, you need to download and install the latest version of git. This should take no more than 5-10 minutes. (You can also use the Git GUI, but you'll have to learn it on your own)
In the git bash, type in these commands, and press enter after each one:

	git init
	git remote add origin https://github.com/IMPACT-Boulder/Accelerator
	git pull origin master

The first command creates a blank repository in your chosen folder.
The second command sets up "origin" as the name of the IMPACT-Boulder repository on your computer.
The third command takes the online repository and copies it into your folder. This should take about two minutes to complete.
The word "origin" can be replaced with whatever you want to call the repository. For consistency's sake, please use "origin" on computers in the lab.
Whenever you need the latest version of the code, simply re-enter the command:

	git pull origin master

I recommend doing this once a week or so.

NOTE ON POSSIBLE ERRORS:
If there is an error connecting to the online repository, please check your firewall or antivirus settings.
If you accidentally modify a piece of code, and want to change it back to our version, go to the git bash and enter the command:

	git status

This will pull up all of your changes to the contents of the repository in red. To get rid of any particular change, enter the command:

	git checkout -- <file>

For example:

	git checkout -- Database2.0/User\ Interface/Query_Dust_Event_v2.vi

This command removes all of your changes to the file "Database2.0/User Interface/Query_Dust_Event_v2.vi", and reverts the file to the repository version.
Protip: If you feel like being a boss, you can type in:

	git checkout -- da

Then press Tab, and git will autofill this to:

	git checkout -- Database2.0/

THE CHECKOUT COMMAND IS A PERMANENT CHANGE. Anything you've done to the file will be completely undone when you enter this command. It will not even send your version to the trash.
If you think your change makes the code better, keep reading. That is covered in the next section.

NOTE: Which folder you're in when you open the git bash matters, unless you're doing a "git pull" command. I recommend opening the git bash in the folder that contains the entire git repository.



2. Modifying the repository

Create an account on github.com (if you don't already have one).
Contact Forrest <forrest.barnes@colorado.edu>, Zach Ulibarry, or whoever is the current code dev. for IMPACT and ask for permission to modify the online repository.
One of us will invite you to become a member of IMPACT-Boulder on github. You will get an email about this.
Click on the link in the email (it should look something like https://github.com/orgs/IMPACT-Boulder/invitation?via_email=1), and log into github.com.
Click the green button. This will make you a member of the IMPACT-Boulder github repository and let you make changes.

Make a change (this can be as simple as changing the location of a wire in a vi, adding a comment to the IDL code, getting rid of a typo in the documentation, or adding a new text document), and come back here once you're done.

To give you some intuition about how git works, I'll temporarily refer to different "levels" of change in git. Level 1 is the online repository. Level 2 is the clone of the online repository on your computer. Level 4 (yes, I've skipped 3) is your personal file system, including the changes you just made. Level 3 is a temporary stage where a file is placed after it's been saved, but bevfore it's been committed to the local repository (Level 2) or the online repository (Level 1).
More concisely, any change you make to the code has to be "staged" temporarily, "committed" to the local repository, and then "pushed" to the online repository.
Now enter the following command:

	git pull origin master

DO THIS EVERY TIME YOU START OR FINISH MAKING CHANGES TO THE REPOSITORY.
This pulls all changes from the online repository (Level 1) onto your local repository. It does not change anything you've done to the files (Level 3-4), but it makes sure that the things you commit to the local repository (Level 2) don't conflict with something somebody else has done. This is particularly important with Labview code, where resolving these conflicting changes is an incredible headache.

	git status

The above command is your bread and butter. It shows you every difference between your code (Level 4) and the local repository (Level 2). It also shows what changes have been staged (Level 3) but not committed to the local repository yet.
To stage a file (prepare to put it in the local repository), use the following command:

	git add <file>

Protip: Enter the first two or more characters of the file or folder name, then press Tab. git will auto-fill the file or folder for you. If git comes up with more than one result, you can enter more characters or keep pressing Tab until it displays the right file or folder.
Now if you use the "git status" command again, you'll see that the file you staged is in green text. This means that it's ready to commit to the local repository. If you change and save the file again before commiting it, it will become unstaged again and go back to red text. As you can see in the "git status" text, you can also unstage it by entering the command:

	git reset HEAD <file>

If you're certain the change you made was okay, enter the following command:

	git commit -m "message" --author="name <email>"

For instance, on 20 May 2015, Forrest altered Live_Plot.vi and Query_Dust_Event_v2.vi with changes to the radius axis in both vis. His commands were probably:

	git add Database2.0/User\ Interface/Live_Plot.vi
	git add Database2.0/User\ Interface/Query_Dust_Event_v2.vi
	git commit -m "Added Radius axis to Live Plot. Fixed Radius axis for Query Dust Event v2." --author="Forrest Barnes <forrest.barnes@colorado.edu>"

The "--author=" option helps us keep track of who did what. The "-m" option tells us what changes were made. This is particularly important in Labview vis, because it's often virtually impossible to tell where a change happened in  that mess. Github helps, because it narrows the changes down to a particular file, but it's usually not enough. Be detailed.
Now it's time to push your changes to the repository. If you've forgotten to enter the command "git pull origin master" yet, you should do that before continuing.

	git push origin master

Since we're using an online repository, we will need to verify that a legitimate user is making these changes. This means you need to enter your git username and password. Entering your password will seem to do nothing, but that's just git hiding your password from prying eyes.
If you're certain that you are the only person who will be using a particular computer for a period of time, you can enter this command to save your github username and password on the disk:

	git config credential.helper store

The next time you do a "git push" and enter your username and password, git will remember those credentials and save them (unencrypted, but unavailable to other users) in a file called .git-credentials. On Windows, this can be found in C:/Users/<your username>/.git-credentials. If you stop using the computer, delete this file, and your credentials will go away with it. I recommend against using this shortcut.

NOTE ON POSSIBLE ERRORS:
If git complains about the difference between a "matching" and "simple" push value, enter the following command into the git bash:

	git config --global push.default simple

If "git pull" gives you a merge error, you probably committed a change to your local respoitory that conflicts with a change somebody made to the online repository. This means somebody has to sort through the differences between your local repository and the online repository. For now, enter the command:

	git log --merge

This shows all conflicting commits. DO NOT AUTO-MERGE THE COMMITS. This may work for some text-based programming issues, but it won't work for Labview. Record which files were affected somewhere. Now enter the command:

	git merge --abort

This 
If you've made any changes you want to keep (in the files you recorded), copy the files you changed to a location outside the repository. Now enter the command:

	git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD

Now use "git pull origin master" and compare the files in the repository to the files (if any) you copied to outside the repository. Find the differences between the files, add the changes you made to the local repository version of the file, commit the changes, and push the changes to the online repository.
This sort of thing should not happen if you are vigilant about your "git pull"s. I will explain what some of the above commands do in the next section.



3. Reviewing/managing changes

Open the git bash and enter the command:

	git log

This shows all past changes to the git respository. This log goes all the way back to 11 November 2013, when Anthony Shu first put these files into git. You will notice that each commit has a hash code, for instance:

	commit afe0e5f471b462ac4a974dbf56b5d5e571899d1e
	author:	Andrew Collette
	date:	Tue May 19 16:48:27 2015 -0600
	
		Create README.md

If you want to see what the code looked like just after this commit, you can use the command:

	git checkout afe0e5f471b462ac4a974dbf56b5d5e571899d1e

You only need the first few characters to make this command work, just enough to have a unique code, different from all the other hash codes in the log. This will reset the local repository to that commit. If you want to delete all commits until that point (rid them from the repository forever), use the command:

	git reset --hard afe0e5

Please don't do this. A better command is "git revert", which leaves the previous versions still in the git log. This effectively creates a new commit that is the exact opposite of the previous commit(s). To revert all the commits back to just after Andrew's commit, use the command:

	git revert -n afe0e5..HEAD

The "-n" option is not necessary, but recommended. It effectively compiles all the commit-undoing into one big commit-undo.
To revert the last 3 changes, the command is:

	git revert -n HEAD~3..HEAD

Now use "git commit" to apply the change.



4. Using Github

Log in to github.com/
If you are a member of IMPACT-Boulder, you can click on your name in the top left part of the screen and "Switch dashboard context" to IMPACT-Boulder. This is just a fancy way of getting to github.com/IMPACT-Boulder/

The most important feature github gives us is "Issues". This is a tab on the far right, just below "< > Code".
If you believe the code needs changing in some way, this is a good place to state what you want and assign somebody to make it happen. If you are working on something that takes more than a day to do, you can create an issue and assign it to yourself, to let other people know what you're doing.

Another useful feature is easy to see from github.com/IMPACT-Boulder/Accelerator. From here, we can see how long ago each file and folder has been changed, what the change was, and who did it. In addition, the latest change is shown at the top of the menu.

There are many features git has that we don't use, such as branching. If you find them useful, feel free to use them. Also, feel free to update this resource and speak with Tobin Munsat or one of the code devs concerning anything potentially useful about git or github.
